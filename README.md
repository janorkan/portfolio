# Data Science Portfolio

Hi, this is me showing you a selection of my python & data science portfolio projects.

My Name is Jan. I'm from Germany and here are some short information about my education and work experience.

### Education
Physics & Economy, Diploma

### Work Experience
- IT project manager for a team of 20 IT developers, working with SCRUM, KANBAN and modern DevOps practices
- Business process management for customer-facing service processes and internal supporting processes with data mining experience in SQL
- Quality management and business intelligence tasks with SQL and PowerBI
- Owned small company for database and cloud consulting and analytics, regarding performance benchmarking

As you can see, I'm not an educated software engineer or data scientist. I came to data science due to my passion for mathematics, data and working in analytical jobs for a few years. While I learned JAVA and C at university, I taught myself Python for my data science projects.

What sets me apart from many other data scientists is my experience and my understanding of business contexts and processes.
