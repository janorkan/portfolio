## :raised_hands: About Me

My Name is Jan. I'm from Germany and here are some short information about my education and work experience.

### Education
Physics & Economy, Diploma

### Work Experience
- IT project manager for a team of 20 IT developers, working with SCRUM, KANBAN and modern DevOps practices
- Business process management for customer-facing service processes and internal supporting processes with data mining experience in SQL
- Quality management and business intelligence tasks with SQL and PowerBI
- Owned small company for database/cloud consulting and analytics, regarding performance benchmarking. Mainly responsible for all entrepreneurial tasks like funding, staffing, OKRs, financial planning, marketing and international sales.

As you can see, I'm not an educated software engineer or data scientist. I came to data science due to my passion for mathematics, data and working in analytical jobs for a few years. While I learned JAVA and C at university, I taught myself Python for my data science projects.

What sets me apart from many other data scientists is my experience and my understanding of business contexts and processes. The business impact sets the goal and effort of any IT project. 

Let's have a look at my recent projects.
